# MonteCarloRDF
#This program is written for MC annealing for the potential taken from the paper by Stillinger et. al. Phys. Rev. E (2006)
#Calculation of the RDF for MC simulation and attempting to get the potential function out of it using the potential of mean force given by:
#------------------   u(r) = -kT ln(g(r))
#This attempt forms the first attempt to come up with an inverse potential fron=m the simulation.
